# Flashcards App

A flashcard is a card bearing information on both sides, which is intended to be used as an aid in memorization. In this case, we are gonna use them to learn the 100 most commom **italian** words.
Each card has a italian word in the front and, after 3 seconds, reveals the back which contains the translation in english for that word. If you already knew the correct translation, you can press the check button, and that word will not appear to you anymore, otherwise you click the x button and that word will be thrown into the word mix again. Don't worry, your progress wil be saved!

Concepts used:

	<li>Tkinter</li> 
	<li>Pandas</li> 
	<li>Erros handling (Try/Except)</li> 
</ul>
